This variable sets the distance that the player must move before the screen 
automatically centers itself when "lookspring" is set to "1". This variable is 
only useful to people who only play with the keyboard, have "lookspring" set to
"1" and do not have "+klook" or "+mlook" enabled at that time. When the player 
moves the distance specified in this variable the screen will pop back to the 
center position.
