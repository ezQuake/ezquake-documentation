This variable sets how quickly your view returns to the center after looking up
or down and moving after that and "lookspring" is set to "1". This variable is 
only useful to people who only play with the keyboard, have "lookspring" set to
"1" and do not have "+klook" or "+mlook" enabled at that time. When the player 
moves the distance specified in this variable the screen will pop back to the 
center position.
