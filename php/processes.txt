variables documentation: current state + plans
made by johnny_cz

we have this data sources:
A) cvars-xml-list - single file with support info, default values and group
B) cvars-xmls-desc - separated files with cvars description
C) cvars-xml-desc - single huge file with cvars descriptions
D) cvars-html-incs - +/- ten files (each for one ubergroup) with full info of cvars in HTML
E) cvars-xml-full - single large xml file with full info about all cvars

auto-generated:
(A) (D) (E)

what are they used to:
A): to generate (E)
B): for /describe and to generate (E)
C): to generate (B) when converting some ugly .txt files into XML
D): for online HTML manual (online version of /describe)
E): to generate (D)

generation processes:
1) A+B => E
2) E => D
3) hexum => A
4) C => B

that means (to-do):
1) customize current scripts/html-variables.php (+ replace 'html' in name with 'xml')
  - already mines data from (A)
  - needs to mine data from (B) (not from (C) as it's now)
  - it should also tell which variables are undocumented and which should be removed from (B)
2) some nice XSLT (find&replace even) - need shaman's help
3) already done by hexum (but I really need that 'tool' for me too)
4) already done: scripts/parse-cvars-descs.php

where are they placed:
1) data/cvarlist.xml
2) data/variables/*.xml
3) data/src-cvars-data/*.xml
4) docs/vars/*.inc
5) needs to be created first, will be placed here: data/cvarsfull.xml
