<h4 class="option">
-allow360
</h4>
<p>
The default behaviour is: We only have room for 15 fullscreen modes, so don't allow 360-wide modes, because if there are 5 320-wide modes and
5 360-wide modes, we'll run out of space.
Using this commandline option you can change this behaviour.
</p>

<h4 class="option">
-allowmultiple
</h4>
<p>
Allows multiple instances of client. Allowed only in debug builds.</p>

<h4 class="option">
-autostretch
</h4>
<p>
This switch enables the stretching of the screen through pixel doubling when 
using high resolutions.
</p>

<h4 class="option">
-basedir
</h4>
<p>
This switch sets the location of the game data files. You can use this switch to 
keep the executable files separate of the game files and then use this command 
to point the game executable at the location of the game files. This might be 
useful on networked file systems so that only one copy of the game files is kept 
while people can use their own executable to run the game. This switch is 
very similar to the "-path" switch.<br />
Example:<br /><code>
ezquake.exe -basedir c:\games\quake<br />
ezquake.exe -basedir /usr/quake</code>
</p>

<h4 class="option">
-bpp (16/24/32) *gl only*

</h4>
<p>
Sets the console buffer size in kilobytes. Default is 64 kB. Maximum is 4 MB.</p>

<h4 class="option">
-condebug 
</h4>
<p>
This switch enables logging of the console text in the "qconsole.log" file in 
the quake/qw/ directory. This is very useful if you are trying to catch bugs in 
the game. You can also use this command to keep a log of all the conversations 
that go on when you play on a server.
</p>

<h4 class="option">
-conheight *gl only*
</h4>
<p>
This switch specifies the vertical resolution for the console screen.<br />
<em>Note:</em> You can use this command to stretch the size of the console to the actual 
      screen resolution in order to prevent the squashed font look. When you use 
      this command you should also use the -conwidth command to specify the 
      horizontal resolution.<br />
Example:<br /><code>
ezquake-gl.exe -conwidth 800 -conheight 600<br />
ezquake-gl.exe -conwidth 640 -conheight 480</code>
</p>

<h4 class="option">

      available OpenGL video modes.<br />
Example: <code>ezquake-gl.exe -force 2</code>
</p>

<h4 class="option">
-forceTextureReload
</h4>
<p>
Forces reloading textures.</p>

<h4 class="option">
-fullsbar *gl only*
</h4>
<p>
Enable the refreshing of the full status bar. <br />
Note: Normally the game will not refresh the full status bar, only the parts 
of it that change. This can sometimes cause flicker when a number changes on 
the status bar. When you use this parameter the status bar will be rendered 
with every frame thus it will remain refreshed all the time. 
</p>

<p>
Linux (glx) only. Fullscreen mode.
</p>

<h4 class="option">
-gl_ext
</h4>
<p>
Prints loaded OpenGL extensions into the console on startup.
</p>

<h4 class="option">
-heapsize (0..128000)
</h4>
<p>
This switch will specify the amount of memory in kilobytes allocated for Quake.<br />
Note: You might need to use this parameter when playing on or developing large 
      maps which require a lot of memory. Also if you start receiving the 
      microchip icon on your game screen you might need to use this parameter to 
      allocate more memory for the game.<br />
Example: <code>
ezquake-gl.exe -heapsize 24576</code>
</p>

<h4 class="option">
-height *gl only*
</h4>
<p>
This switch specifies the width of the video resolution to run the game in.<br />
Note: You should also use the "-width" parameter when using this parameter to 
      specify the horizontal resolution.<br />
Example: <code>
ezquake-gl.exe -width 512 -height 384</code>
</p>

<h4 class="option">
-ip
</h4>
<p>
Server command.
</p>

<h4 class="option">

</h4>
<p>
Enable the joystick.
</p>

<h4 class="option">
-m_mwhook
</h4>
<p>
Allows you to bind up to eight mouse buttons on Logitech mouse. You have to use MouseWare. You must have mw_hook.dll in your quake dir (same dir where the game executables are). Works both when using -dinput and not using -dinput. The idea of doing this originally came from [EZH]FAN. It was first implemented by BorisU in qw262.</p>

<h4 class="option">
-m_smooth
</h4>
<p>
This is meant to smooth your mouse movements and maximize mouse responsiveness. 
If you're unlucky and cannot get rate 200 with your mouse/windows/drivers, and 
don't want to use m_filter, because of the latency it brings to your movements, 
then this is for you. However, also if you have a smooth mouse with 200 Hz 
sample rate you can give it a try.<br />
Requirements:</p>
<ul><li>"-dinput" in your command-line (currently it only works with direct input, 
  but that may change in future</li>
<li>"-m_smooth" in your command-line</li>
<li>your mouse rate must be at least as high as the FPS you play at, or your mouse 
  will still move roughly (if you use PS2 mouse and Win9X try ps2rate)</li>
<li>"m_rate &lt;rate&gt; must be set to your mouse rate (use "m_showrate 1" if you are
  not sure)</li>
</ul>

<h4 class="option">

<h4 class="option">
-mem
</h4>
<p>
Specify memory in megabytes to allocate (default is 8MB, which should be fine for most needs). 
</p>

<h4 class="option">
-minmemory 
</h4>
<p>
This switch allows you to define the minimum amount of memory that should be
allocated for Quake.<br />
Example: <code>
ezquake-gl.exe -minmemory 16000</code><br />
Note: It is best to leave this parameter alone and instead use the "-heapsize" 
      parameter to specify the amount of memory that the game can use.
</p>

<h4 class="option">
-mmt
</h4>
<p>
Linux only. Enables <a href="?evdev">EVDEV support</a>.
</p>

<h4 class="option">

<h4 class="option">
-no24bit
</h4>
<p>Prevents loading 24-bit textures, charsets, images, etc.</p>

<h4 class="option">
-noadjustaspect
</h4>
<p>
When not used, client uses following algorithm adjusting the size of the screen: If the width is more than twice the height, reduce it by half because this is probably a dual-screen monitor.
If this command line option is used then this algorithm will be disabled.
</p>

 
<h4 class="option">
-noconinput
</h4>
<p>
Linux server stuff.
</p>

Note: DIB full screen modes are nothing more than window display modes which 
      have been sized to the exact size of the screen. This parameter will 
      disable support for such modes.
</p>

<h4 class="option">
-nohwgamma *gl only*
</h4>
<p>
Disables hardware gamma control.
</p>

<h4 class="option">

Linux (glx) only. Do not use direct mouse input.
</p>

<h4 class="option">
-nomouse 
</h4>
<p>
This switch will disable mouse support. Using this switch will increase your
FPS, but obviously the disadvantage of having to play without mouse will in
almost every case outweigh the FPS gain.
</p>

<h4 class="option">
-nomtex
</h4>
<p>
This extension will be autodetected and used.  If for some reason it is not
working correctly, specify the command line option "-nomtex" to disable it.
Should disable waterfog.
</p>

<h4 class="option">
-nopriority
</h4>
<p>
Server for Win32 automatically sets itself as a high priority task (HIGH_PRIORITY_CLASS). 
This is necessary for avoiding high PL when playing on localhost under Windows9x. 
If you desire to turn this feature off, launch the server with -nopriority command-line 
parameter. By the way, the reason for high ping (when QW2.30 server is running under Windows9x) 
was eliminated. Server uses 32 Megabytes of memory by default.
</p>

<h4 class="option">
-noscripts
</h4>
<p>
Disables usage of movement scripts, sets allow_scripts 0 and puts information about client not using scripts in userinfo string.
</p>

<h4 class="option">

Disables usage of different pinging method (for Server Browser).
</p>

<h4 class="option">
-nosound 
</h4>
<p>
This switch will disable sound support. Using this switch will increase your
FPS, but obviously the disadvantage of having to play without sound will in
almost every case outweigh the FPS gain.
</p>

<h4 class="option">
-nostdout
</h4>
<p>
This behavior can be modified using the -nostdin or -allstdin flags. 
Standard output and error are also forwarded to mpiexec, allowing redirection 
of the outputs of all processes. This can be turned off using -nostdout so that 
the standard output and error streams go through the normal PBS mechanisms, to the 
batch job output files, or to your terminal in the case of an interactive job.
</p>

<h4 class="option">
-noswapctrl
</h4>
<p>
When used prevents loading Vsync control extensions.
</p>

<h4 class="option">
-notriplebuf
</h4>
<p>
This switch will disable triple-buffer page flipping for the video.<br />
Note: This parameter will disable support for triple buffer thus it will make 
      the performance of the Accelerated VESA video drivers similar to the 
      Linear VESA drivers.
</p>

<h4 class="option">
-novbeaf
</h4>
<p>
This command line switch will disable support for the Accelerated VESA video 
modes.
</p>

<h4 class="option">
-nowd

</h4>
<p>
This command line switch will disable support for all VESA video modes.
</p>

<h4 class="option">
-nowindirect

DirectDraw video modes or windowed display.
</p>

<h4 class="option">
-particles (0..5000)
</h4>
<p>
This switch specifies the maximum number of particles to be rendered on the 
screen at once.
</p>

<h4 class="option">
-port
</h4>
<p>
Set the port for game server.
</p>

<h4 class="option">
-primarysound [WIN32]
</h4>
<p>
This switch will force the client to use DirectSound's primary buffer output for 
sound instead of secondary buffer output.<br />
Note: Normally the game will use the secondary sound buffer because it is more 
      compatible across more hardware. If you know that your hardware is 
      100% DirectX DirectSound compliant you can use this setting in order to 
      increase the performance of the game. However when you switch the focus 
      away from QW (task-switch), you will lose sound output until you restart 
      QW.
</p>
      
<h4 class="option">
-resetwinpos 
</h4>
<p>
This switch will reset the position of the game window on the desktop. If the 
game window will ever become inaccessible because it was moved beyond the 
boundaries of the desktop you will have to use this command to reset the 
position information for the game window. The position information is stored in 
the "vid_window_x" and "vid_window_y" variables.
</p>

<h4 class="option">
-ruleset <kbd>&lt;ruleset name&gt;</kbd>
</h4>
<p>
Disables triggers,truelighting and enable to play with 77 fps on kteam server.<br />
Example: <code>ezquake-gl.exe -ruleset smackdown</code>
</p>

<h4 class="option">
-showliberrors
</h4>
<p>
Prints all errors of loading modules.
</p>

<h4 class="option">
-simsound 
</h4>
<p>
This switch will disable sound playback but simulate sound playback for code 
testing. When this switch is used the game will function as if sound is being 
played back normally, except that the sound card will not be initialized and 
nothing will be heard from the speakers. This command will cut off the sound 
information right before it is about to leave to the sound card for processing. 
This command was used for testing the sound code in the game.
</p>

<h4 class="option">
-sndbits (8/16)
</h4>
<p>
This defines how many sampling bits should be used, when using 16 bits the 
interpolation quality will be better.
</p>

<h4 class="option">
-snddev &lt;N&gt;
</h4>
<p>
Allows you to choose from multiple sound devices.</p>

<h4 class="option">
-sndspeed (8000/11025/22050/44100/48000)
</h4>
<p>
The client includes "sound interpolation" which allows it to play sounds at higher 
frequencies, than the default 11025 Hz with perfect quality. In addition to 
"-sndspeed" also "-sndbits" will have an influence on interpolation quality.
This command-line allows you to choose the frequency you want to interpolate 
the sounds to.
You will quickly discover, that the shaft sound is different at increased 
sampling rate. That's because shaft sounds were recorded at 22050 kHz, so 
probably that's how they should sound from the beginning. If you don't like 
it, you can always convert them to 11025.
</p>

<h4 class="option">
-sndmono
</h4>
<p>
Use the mono sound system (Linux)
</p>

<h4 class="option">
-sndstereo
</h4>
<p>
Use the stereo sound system (Linux)
</p>

<h4 class="option">
-snoforceformat 
</h4>
<p>
This switch will disable the forcing of the soundcard into the appropriate sound 
mode.<br />
Note: When this parameter is used the game will not try to force the sound card 
      into the 11,025Hz at 16-bit stereo sound mode. Use this parameter if you 
      are having problems with the sound initialization for your sound card.
</p>

<h4 class="option">
-startwindowed
</h4>
<p>
Same as "-window" option.
</p>

<h4 class="option">
-surfcachesize
</h4>
<p>
This switch sets the amount of memory in kilobytes that should be allocated in 
kilobytes for the surface cache.<br />
Note: It is not necessary to use this parameter by default because the game will 
      automatically allocate the necessary amount of memory for storing 
      textures.
</p>

<h4 class="option">
-use8bit
</h4>
<p>
Enable 8bit mode,
</p>

<h4 class="option">
-wavonly
</h4>
<p>
This switch is used to disable DirectSound support in favor of WAV playback. If 
your sound card does not support DirectX DirectSound then you will need to 
specify this parameter in order to force the game into use the Windows wave only 
sound output. You can also try this switch when having sound problems, however 
there will be a considerable loss in performance when using this parameter and
the sound latency will be increased greatly, but at least you may be able to hear 
sounds.
</p>

<h4 class="option">
-width *gl only*
</h4>
<p>
This switch specifies the width of the video resolution to run the game in.<br />
Note: You also need the -height command.<br />
Example: <code>
ezquake-gl.exe -width 512 -height 384</code>
</p>


<h4 class="option">
-window *gl only* 
</h4>
<p>
This switch forces OpenGL verion of the client to run in a windowed mode.</p>


<h4 class="option">
-winsize
</h4>
<p>
Set the winsize (Linux?)
</p>

<h4 class="option">
-v_hz
</h4>
<p>
Linux (glx) only.
</p>

<h4 class="option">
-verbose
</h4>
<p>
Linux stuff
</p>

<h4 class="option">
-visualid
</h4>
<p>
Linux stuff
</p>

<h4 class="option">
-zone
</h4>
<p>
This switch is used to allocate additional memory to the alias memory space.
It is usually necessary when loading large scripts.
It's already built to the client so you dont need this commandline command.
</p>
