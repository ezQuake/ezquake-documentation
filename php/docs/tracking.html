<p>There are 3 ways of using the 'track' command.</p>

<p>The first is 'track player_name' (use name completion with this obviously).</p>

<p>The second is 'track userid' (pretty useless).</p>

<p>The third is the best and most important.  It is demonstrated below.</p>

<pre><code>
bind  KP_1	"track #1"
bind  KP_2	"track #2"
bind  KP_3	"track #3"
bind  KP_3	"track #4"
bind  KP_5	"track #5"
bind  KP_6	"track #6"
bind  KP_7	"track #7"
bind  KP_8	"track #8"
</code></pre>

<p>In a 4v4 mvd, the above 8 binds will make the keypad numbers 1,2,3,4 track the four players on one team
and make the keypad numbers 5,6,7,8 track the four players on the other team.</p>

<p>In a 2v2 keypad numbers 1,2 = first team and 3,4 = second team.</p>

<p>You can bind more keys (all the way up to 'track #32') if you are watching a 16v16 etc.</p>

<p>Oh and if you are watching an 8 way ffa, then the above binds assign one keypad number to each of the players.</p>

<p>If its a 2v2v2 then keypad numbers 1,2 = first team, 3,4 = next team and 5,6 = last team.</p>

<p>So basically #1 #2 #3 ...  order the players by teams.</p>

<p>We recommend making a config just for spectating and watching mvd's with cfg_save/cfg_load .</p>

<p>See <a href="?multiview">Multiview</a> manual too.</p>
