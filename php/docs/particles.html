<p>This feature and manual page has been inherited from the <a href="http://www.fuhquake.net/">FuhQuake</a> client 
made by A Nourai aka 'fuh' (#fuhquake on Quakenet irc).</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This client has the option of using visually
enhanced particle effects for explosions, rocket trails, teleport splashes,
gunshot effects and more.</p>

<p>The new effects are visually superior to the old effects but may have an impact
on FPS (especially on lower end systems).</p>

<p>The new effects are off by default.  You can turn them on by setting the
variables below to 1.  Use cfg_save (read config_manager.txt) to save/load
your settings.</p>


<h2>Customising Particles</h2>
<p>The following variables use the new visually enhanced particles when set to 1
and use the old system when set to 0.  All of them default to 0.</p>

<table>
  <tr><td>gl_part_explosions</td><td>determines particles used for explosions.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>gl_part_trails</td><td>determines particles used for (rocket etc) trails.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>gl_part_spikes</td><td>determines particles used for spikes (nailgun etc).</td></tr>
  <tr><td>gl_part_gunshots</td><td>determines particles used for gunshot (etc) effects.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>gl_part_blood</td><td>determines particles used for blood effects.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>gl_part_telesplash</td><td>determines particles used for teleport splashes.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>gl_part_blobs</td><td>determines particles used for blob explosions (EMP's).</td></tr>
  <tr><td>gl_part_lavasplash</td><td>determines particles used for lava splashes (Spy Gren).</td></tr>
  <tr><td>gl_part_inferno</td><td>determines particles used for pyro flames in TF.</td></tr>
</table>

<h2>Fps Variables</h2>

<p>The following variables control the behaviour of the new particle effects.
They do not effect the old particle effects.</p>
<dl>
<dt>gl_bounceparticles</dt><dd>Controls whether sparks rebound off walls.  Bouncing
                        particles look nicer, but may eat up CPU.</dd>

<dt>gl_clipparticles</dt><dd>Setting this to 1 will limit the number of blended particles
                        close to you.  This gives a big FPS increase when blended
                        particles take up a big proportion of your screen and
                        challenge your video card's fillrate.
                        </dd>

<p>The particle engine has evolved from the QMB particle engine.

<h2>FAQ</h2>
<dl>
<dt>Q1. What are Blop Explosions and Lava Splash?</dt>
<dd>A1. These are really only used in teamfortress.  Blob explosions are what
happens when an EMP grenade explodes (and when a spy grenade first explodes).
LavaSplash is the red stuff a spy's gas grenade creates.  LavaSplash also
happens sometimes in dm when the map ends.</dd>

<dt>Q2. I lose a lot of FPS with when using the new QMB effects.  WTF?</dt>
<dd>A2. Tough.  Good things come at a price.</dd>

<dt>Q3. The new effects don't look so good. WTF?</dt>
<dd>A3. Make sure you have ezquake/pak0.pak (should have been installed when you
installed the .exe's).</dd>

<dt>Q4. What about axe effects ?</dt>
<dd>A4. There's a lot of effects in quakeworld, especially when you consider custom
mods like teamfortress.  Hence it is impossible to have a variable for every
effect.  Things which do not have variable (like axe effects) are controlled by
the gl_part_gunshots variable.</dd>

<dt>Q5. I have set the gl_part_* variables to 1 but I still get the old particles. WTF?</dt>
<dd>A5. Make sure you've installed ezquake/pak0.pak from the zip file/installer you
downloaded from the web.  Inside that pak file are some particle textures that are
important.</dd>
