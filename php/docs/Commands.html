Most players
 execute this command and never remove it. This way they can use
the keyboard to
 move the player forward and back and strafe left and right,
while using the
 mouse to turn the player left and right and to make him look up
and down. In
 order to have this command set permanently you will have to
create a file called
 autoexec.cfg in the qw/ directory and put in the line "+mlook"
into that file.
 By doing this the game will automatically execute the
autoexec.cfg file and it
 will also active that command.
 Almost every player uses this command nowadays, because the
combination of using
 mouse and keyboard is widely considered the best.</p>
